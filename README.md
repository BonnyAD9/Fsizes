# Fsizes
This app helps managing space on disk by displaying sizes of folders

## Why not use normal file explorer
File explorers usualy don't display sizes of folders because they wold have to visit each file in that folder and subfolders and subsubfolders and subsubsub...

That can be very slow for folders with large amount of files.

This app can display sizes of folders and files in given directory for all folders at once and you can quicky navigate between folders. This can help you find why is your disk so full because you can easily spot large folders and files.

## How it works
This app still has to visit every file. You will have to wait until it visits all the files in the given directory and loads all necesary data. Than you can easily navigate the
files without waiting because all the data is already loded.
